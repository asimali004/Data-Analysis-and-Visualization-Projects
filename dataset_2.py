Analysis: We have chosen pie chart to display the trend of this dataset as it is the most appropriate choice. We can conclude that Asia has the highest amount of domestic exports, with 60.68 percent of the world's exports, when compared to other continents and this is logical since Asia is the biggest continent by land mass than any other continent hence it constitutes a lot more countries.
